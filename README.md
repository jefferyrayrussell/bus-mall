These are the critical technical specifications for this project:
  * three random photos will be placed on an image page side by side.
  * the user will select the image of the product they would most likely buy.
  * three new images will be displayed after each selection.
  * after 25 selections the user will be provided two buttons to either select to receive the results or make 10 more selections.  
  * for each item displayed this data will be gathered:
      * the total number of times an image was displayed.
      * the total number of clicks received.
      * the percentage of times an item was clicked when it was shown.
  * the data gathered for each image will be displayed in a colorful bar chart using ChartJs and placed below the area of the three images.
  * the results will be given ongoing persistence through a page refresh or a browser closing, by being preserved in local storage.
